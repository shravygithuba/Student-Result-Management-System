#  Student Result Management System

A beginner-friendly Java console application for managing student results. This project demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts like classes, arrays, file handling, and user interaction through a menu-driven interface.

##  Key Features

- Add new student records with subject-wise marks
- View all stored student details and results
- Search for a student using their roll number
- Calculate total marks, average, and pass/fail status
- Save and load data from a local file

##  Technologies Used

- Java (Core)
- File Handling (`File`, `Scanner`, `PrintWriter`)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

##  Folder Structure

StudentResultManager/
│
├── Main.java # Contains menu and program logic
├── Student.java # Class to store student data
├── StudentDatabase.java # Handles list of students and file operations
